INSTALLATION/SETUP NOTES

This is a system call. So you would need to compile and install a kernel.
Download a suitable version on kernel from this site: https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
Extract the kernel using tar -xvf filename
You can also use the existing kernel. (found in /usr/src)
